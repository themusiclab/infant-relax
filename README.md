# Infants relax in response to unfamiliar foreign lullabies

This repository contains data and code for Bainbridge & Bertolo et al. (2020, *Nature Human Behaviour*). You can read the paper at https://rdcu.be/b8IWP. The pre-registration and stimuli are available at https://osf.io/2t6cy.

## Anatomy of the repo
`IPL.Rmd` contains the manuscript and all analyses, including those figures that are generated dynamically.

`/data` contains all data: infant-wise heart rate (`IPL_hr_clean.csv`), pupillometry (`IPL_pupils.csv`), electrodermal activity (`IPL_eda.clean.csv`), blinks (`IPL_blink_clean.csv`), and gaze (`IPL_gaze_clean.csv`); de-identified infant-wise metadata (`IPL_studylog.csv`); and data from the parent singer choice task (`IPL_singerselector.csv`). We also included a copy of naïve listener ratings of the songs (`NAIV_Exp1.csv`), which is copied from https://osf.io/d7cn9.

`/viz` contains static `pdf` visualizations used in the paper.
